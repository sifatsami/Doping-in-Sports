# Doping-in-Sports
This project analyzes doping cases in sports by scraping Wikipedia, cleaning the data, and visualizing trends using Python. It gathers athlete details, substances, and locations, then processes the data with Pandas. Interactive dashboards built with Dash and Plotly display a world map, word cloud, and timeline of doping cases to explore patterns.
